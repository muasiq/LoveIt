Everthing has to start from zero. Here to the zero. What comes after 0 varies. For some, It's 1. Again for some, there are infinite steps to get to 1. If you focus on the infinite steps you may never get to 1. You will succumb to the infinite barriers. It's better to focus on the 1 and keep working.
